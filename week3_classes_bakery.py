# 1. Bakery
# Create a class called 'Invoice' that a bakery uses to represent an invoice for items sold. We assume this bakery
# takes large orders of one specific item only. Ex.: an order of 50 baguettes.
# An Invoice should include the following information: item type, quantity of item, a price per item and the date the
# order should be delivered.

# Create a new python file Invoice.py

# Create a class Bakery that contains a constructor __init__ that takes the information mentioned above as arguments.
