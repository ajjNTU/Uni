# Task 5 [Advanced]: Quiz
# 1. Create a new python file "quiz.py".
# 2. Write a quiz program that asks the user a multiple-choice question. After the user answers the question,
# the program should display either "correct" or "incorrect".
# 3. Modify your program to include three questions instead of one.
# 4. Modify your program again to include a message at the end of the quiz that tells the user how many questions were
# answered correctly.
# [hint] you can use a variable that keeps count of correct answers. The value stored in the variable will change after
# question is answered to reflect the new count of correct answers, if any.
